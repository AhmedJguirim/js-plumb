# flowchart

This demonstration uses version 6.x of the jsPlumb Community Edition.

This is a demonstration of a simple Flowchart using jsPlumb.  There are two versions of the demo in this repository - `ts` contains a Typescript version, using Rollup + Babel, and `js` contains a 'vanilla' Javascript version.
