## AbstractConnector.\_findSegmentForLocation() method

returns \[segment, proportion of travel in segment, segment index\] for the segment that contains the point which is 'location' distance along the entire path, where 'location' is a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive. in this connector type, paths are made up of a list of segments, each of which contributes some fraction to the total length. From 1.3.10 this also supports the 'absolute' property, which lets us specify a location as the absolute distance in pixels, rather than a proportion of the total path.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
_findSegmentForLocation(location: number, absolute?: boolean): {
        segment: Segment;
        proportion: number;
        index: number;
    };
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  location | number |  |
|  absolute | boolean |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

{ segment: Segment; proportion: number; index: number; }
