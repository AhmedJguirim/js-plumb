|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [anchor?](./core.endpointoptions.anchor.md) | AnchorSpec | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional definition for both the source and target anchors for any connection created with this endpoint as its source. If you do not supply this, the default <code>anchors</code> definition for the jsPlumb instance will be used |
|  [anchors?](./core.endpointoptions.anchors.md) | \[AnchorSpec, AnchorSpec\] | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional definition for the source and target anchors for any connection created with this endpoint as its source. If you do not supply this, the default <code>anchors</code> definition for the jsPlumb instance will be used |
|  [connectionCost?](./core.endpointoptions.connectioncost.md) | number | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional cost to set for connections that have this endpoint as their source. Defaults to 1. |
|  [connectionsDetachable?](./core.endpointoptions.connectionsdetachable.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> Whether or not connections that have this endpoint as their source are configured to be detachable with the mouse. Defaults to true. |
|  [connectionsDirected?](./core.endpointoptions.connectionsdirected.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> Whether or not connections that have this endpoint as their source are considered "directed". |
|  [connector?](./core.endpointoptions.connector.md) | ConnectorSpec | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional connector definition for connections that are created with this endpoint as their source. |
|  [connectorClass?](./core.endpointoptions.connectorclass.md) | string | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional class to assign to connections that have this endpoint as their source. |
|  [connectorHoverClass?](./core.endpointoptions.connectorhoverclass.md) | string | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional class to assign, on mouse hover, to connections that have this endpoint as their source. |
|  [connectorHoverStyle?](./core.endpointoptions.connectorhoverstyle.md) | PaintStyle | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional paint style to assign, on hover, to a connection that is created with this endpoint as its source. |
|  [connectorOverlays?](./core.endpointoptions.connectoroverlays.md) | Array&lt;OverlaySpec&gt; | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional list of overlays to add to a connection that is created with this endpoint as its source. |
|  [connectorStyle?](./core.endpointoptions.connectorstyle.md) | PaintStyle | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional paint style to assign to a connection that is created with this endpoint as its source. |
|  [cssClass?](./core.endpointoptions.cssclass.md) | string | <i>(Optional)</i> |

|  [deleteOnEmpty?](./core.endpointoptions.deleteonempty.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> Whether or not to delete the Endpoint if it transitions to the state that it has no connections. Defaults to false. Note that this only applies if the endpoint previously had one or more connections and now has none: a newly created endpoint with this flag set is not immediately deleted. |
|  [dragAllowedWhenFull?](./core.endpointoptions.dragallowedwhenfull.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> Whether or not connections can be dragged from the endpoint when it is full. Since no new connection could be dragged from an endpoint that is full, in a practical sense this means whether or not existing connections can be dragged off an endpoint that is full. Defaults to true. |
|  [edgeType?](./core.endpointoptions.edgetype.md) | string | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional 'type' for connections that have this endpoint as their source. |
|  [enabled?](./core.endpointoptions.enabled.md) | boolean | <i>(Optional)</i> Whether or not the endpoint is initially enabled. Defaults to true. |
|  [endpoint?](./core.endpointoptions.endpoint.md) | EndpointSpec | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional endpoint definition. If you do not supply this, the default endpoint definition for the jsPlumb instance will be used |
|  [hoverClass?](./core.endpointoptions.hoverclass.md) | string | <i>(Optional)</i> |
|  [hoverPaintStyle?](./core.endpointoptions.hoverpaintstyle.md) | PaintStyle | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional paint style to assign, on hover, to the endpoint. |
|  [maxConnections?](./core.endpointoptions.maxconnections.md) | number | <i>(Optional)</i> Maximum number of connections this endpoint supports. Defaults to 1. Use a value of -1 to indicate there is no limit. |
|  [onMaxConnections?](./core.endpointoptions.onmaxconnections.md) | (value: any, event?: any) =&gt; any | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional callback to fire when the endpoint transitions to the state that it is now full. |
|  [paintStyle?](./core.endpointoptions.paintstyle.md) | PaintStyle | <i>(Optional)</i> Optional paint style to assign to the endpoint |
