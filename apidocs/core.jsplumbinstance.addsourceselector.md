## JsPlumbInstance.addSourceSelector() method

Registers a selector for connection drag on the instance. This is a newer version of the `makeSource` functionality that has been in jsPlumb since the early days. With this approach, rather than calling `makeSource` on every element, you can register a CSS selector on the instance that identifies something that is common to your elements. This will only respond to mouse events on elements that are managed by the instance.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
addSourceSelector(selector: string, params?: BehaviouralTypeDescriptor, exclude?: boolean): SourceSelector;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  selector | string | CSS3 selector identifying child element(s) of some managed element that should act as a connection source. |
|  params | [BehaviouralTypeDescriptor](./core.behaviouraltypedescriptor.md) | Options for the source: connector type, behaviour, etc. |
|  exclude | boolean | If true, the selector defines an 'exclusion': anything \_except\_ elements that match this. |

<b>Returns:</b>
