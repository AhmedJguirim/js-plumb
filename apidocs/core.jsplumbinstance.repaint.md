## JsPlumbInstance.repaint() method

Repaints all connections and endpoints associated with the given element, \_without recomputing the element size and position\_. If you want to first recompute element size and position you should call `revalidate(el)` instead,

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
repaint(el: T["E"], timestamp?: string, offsetsWereJustCalculated?: boolean): RedrawResult;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  el | T\["E"\] |  |
|  timestamp | string | Optional parameter used internally to avoid recalculating offsets multiple times in one paint. |
|  offsetsWereJustCalculated | boolean | If true, we don't recalculate the offsets of child elements of the element we're repainting. |

<b>Returns:</b>
