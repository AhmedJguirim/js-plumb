## EndpointOptions.deleteOnEmpty property

Whether or not to delete the Endpoint if it transitions to the state that it has no connections. Defaults to false. Note that this only applies if the endpoint previously had one or more connections and now has none: a newly created endpoint with this flag set is not immediately deleted.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
deleteOnEmpty?: boolean;
```
