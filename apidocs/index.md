## Packages

|  Package | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [@jsplumb/browser-ui](./browser-ui) | This package is a renderer for the jsPlumb Community edition that uses a single SVG element per connection, and can connect HTML/SVG elements in the DOM. For users of version of jsPlumb prior to 5.x, this package is the equivalent to what used to just be known as "jsPlumb".<!-- -->In actual fact only this renderer exists for the 5.x Community edition, but the code in 5.x is now architected in such a way that alternative renderers could be implemented. |
|  [@jsplumb/browser-ui-lists](./browser-ui-lists) | This package is a list manager that works with the <code>browser-ui</code> renderer. |
|  [@jsplumb/common](./common) | This package contains common declarations and definitions for use by both jsPlumb Community and Toolkit editions. |
|  [@jsplumb/connector-bezier](./connector-bezier) | This package contains the Bezier and StateMachine connectors. Prior to version 5.x these connectors were shipped along with the core. |

|  [@jsplumb/core](./core) | This package is the core of the jsPlumb Community Edition. |
|  [@jsplumb/test](./test) | This package contains the test helper that is used internally by jsPlumb. There is a vague notion that this package could be made useful for others, so all feedback on that topic is welcome. |
