## EventGenerator class

Base class for classes that wish to support binding and firing of events. You need to implement the `shouldFireEvent` method in your concrete subclasses of this class.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare abstract class EventGenerator 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)()](./util.eventgenerator._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>EventGenerator</code> class |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [bind(event, listener, insertAtStart)](./util.eventgenerator.bind.md) |  | Bind an event listener. This method can be used with a type parameter by call sites; although it's not necessary it can be helpful to use this to ensure you've thought about what the payload to your event handler is going to be. |
|  [fire(event, value, originalEvent)](./util.eventgenerator.fire.md) |  | Fire the named event |
|  [getListener(forEvent)](./util.eventgenerator.getlistener.md) |  | gets all listeners for the given named event. |
|  [isSuspendEvents()](./util.eventgenerator.issuspendevents.md) |  | Returns whether not event firing is currently suspended |
|  [setSuspendEvents(val)](./util.eventgenerator.setsuspendevents.md) |  | Sets whether not event firing is currently suspended |
|  [shouldFireEvent(event, value, originalEvent)](./util.eventgenerator.shouldfireevent.md) |  |  |
|  [silently(fn)](./util.eventgenerator.silently.md) |  | Run the given function without firing any events. |
|  [unbind(eventOrListener, listener)](./util.eventgenerator.unbind.md) |  | Unbind the given event listener, or all listeners. If you call this method with no arguments then all event listeners are unbound. |
