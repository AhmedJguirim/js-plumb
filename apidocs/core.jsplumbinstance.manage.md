## JsPlumbInstance.manage() method

Manage an element. Adds the element to the viewport and sets up tracking for endpoints/connections for the element, as well as enabling dragging for the element. This method is called internally by various methods of the jsPlumb instance, such as `connect`<!-- -->, `addEndpoint`<!-- -->, `makeSource` and `makeTarget`<!-- -->, so if you use those methods to setup your UI then you may not need to call this. However, if you use the `addSourceSelector` and `addTargetSelector` methods to configure your UI then you will need to register elements using this method, or they will not be draggable.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
manage(element: T["E"], internalId?: string, _recalc?: boolean): ManagedElement<T["E"]>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  element | T\["E"\] | Element to manage. This method does not accept a DOM element ID as argument. If you wish to manage elements via their DOM element ID, you should use <code>manageAll</code> and pass in an appropriate CSS selector that represents your element, eg <code>#myElementId</code>. |
|  internalId | string | Optional ID for jsPlumb to use internally. If this is not supplied, one will be created. |
|  \_recalc | boolean |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

[ManagedElement](./core.managedelement.md)<!-- -->&lt;T\["E"\]&gt;
