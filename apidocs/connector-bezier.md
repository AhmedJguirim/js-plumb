## connector-bezier package

This package contains the Bezier and StateMachine connectors. Prior to version 5.x these connectors were shipped along with the core.

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [AbstractBezierConnector](./connector-bezier.abstractbezierconnector) |  |
|  [BezierConnector](./connector-bezier.bezierconnector) |  |
|  [BezierSegment](./connector-bezier.beziersegment) |  |
|  [StateMachineConnector](./connector-bezier.statemachineconnector) |  |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [bezierLineIntersection(x1, y1, x2, y2, curve)](./connector-bezier.bezierlineintersection) | Calculates all intersections of the given line with the given curve. |
|  [boundingBoxIntersection(boundingBox, curve)](./connector-bezier.boundingboxintersection) | Calculates all intersections of the given bounding box with the given curve. |
|  [boxIntersection(x, y, w, h, curve)](./connector-bezier.boxintersection) | Calculates all intersections of the given box with the given curve. |
|  [computeBezierLength(curve)](./connector-bezier.computebezierlength) |  |
|  [dist(p1, p2)](./connector-bezier.dist) |  |
|  [distanceFromCurve(point, curve)](./connector-bezier.distancefromcurve) | Calculates the distance that the point lies from the curve. |
|  [gradientAtPoint(curve, location)](./connector-bezier.gradientatpoint) | returns the gradient of the curve at the given location, which is a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive.<!-- -->thanks // http://bimixual.org/AnimationLibrary/beziertangents.html |
|  [gradientAtPointAlongPathFrom(curve, location, distance)](./connector-bezier.gradientatpointalongpathfrom) | returns the gradient of the curve at the point which is 'distance' from the given location. if this point is greater than location 1, the gradient at location 1 is returned. if this point is less than location 0, the gradient at location 0 is returned. |
|  [isPoint(curve)](./connector-bezier.ispoint) |  |
|  [locationAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)](./connector-bezier.locationalongcurvefrom) | finds the location that is 'distance' along the path from 'location'. |
|  [nearestPointOnCurve(point, curve)](./connector-bezier.nearestpointoncurve) | finds the nearest point on the curve to the given point. |
|  [perpendicularToPathAt(curve, location, length, distance)](./connector-bezier.perpendiculartopathat) | calculates a line that is 'length' pixels long, perpendicular to, and centered on, the path at 'distance' pixels from the given location. if distance is not supplied, the perpendicular for the given location is computed (ie. we set distance to zero). |
|  [pointAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)](./connector-bezier.pointalongcurvefrom) | finds the point that is 'distance' along the path from 'location'. |
|  [pointAlongPath(curve, location, distance)](./connector-bezier.pointalongpath) | finds the point that is 'distance' along the path from 'location'. this method returns both the x,y location of the point and also its 'location' (proportion of travel along the path); the method below - \_pointAlongPathFrom - calls this method and just returns the point.<!-- -->TODO The compute length functionality was made much faster recently, using a lookup table. is it possible to use that lookup table find a value for the point some distance along the curve from somewhere? |
|  [pointOnCurve(curve, location)](./connector-bezier.pointoncurve) | calculates a point on the curve, for a Bezier of arbitrary order. |
