## AbstractSegment.findClosestPointOnPath() method

Finds the closest point on this segment to the given x/y, returning both the x and y of the point plus its distance from the supplied point, and its location along the length of the path inscribed by the segment. This implementation returns Infinity for distance and null values for everything else subclasses are expected to override.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
findClosestPointOnPath(x: number, y: number): PointNearPath;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  x | number | X location to find closest point to |
|  y | number | Y location to find closest point to |

<b>Returns:</b>

[PointNearPath](./common.pointnearpath.md)

a `PointNearPath` object, which contains the location of the closest point plus other useful information.
