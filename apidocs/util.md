## util package

This package contains various utility functions used by both the Community and Toolkit editions of jsPlumb.

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [EventGenerator](./util.eventgenerator) | Base class for classes that wish to support binding and firing of events. You need to implement the <code>shouldFireEvent</code> method in your concrete subclasses of this class. |
|  [OptimisticEventGenerator](./util.optimisticeventgenerator) | Subclass of EventGenerator with a default implementation of <code>shouldFireEvent</code>, which returns true always. |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [add(p1, p2)](./util.add) | Adds the x and y values of the two points and returns a new point. |
|  [addToDictionary(map, key, value, insertAtStart)](./util.addtodictionary) | Adds an item to a dictionary whose values consists of array of some type. This method is used internally by jsPlumb and is not intended as part of the public API, and will likely be removed at some point in the future when the code that depends upon it has been refactored. |
|  [addToList(map, key, value, insertAtStart)](./util.addtolist) | Add an item to a list that is stored inside some map. This method is used internally. |
|  [addWithFunction(list, item, hashFunction)](./util.addwithfunction) | Adds an item to a list if the given hash function determines that the item is not already in the list |
|  [clone(a)](./util.clone) | Makes a copy of the given object. |
|  [each(obj, fn)](./util.each) | Iterates through the given <code>obj</code> and applies the given function. if <code>obj</code> is not ArrayLike then the function is executed directly on <code>obj</code>. |
|  [encloses(r1, r2, allowSharedEdges)](./util.encloses) | Calculates whether or not r2 is completely enclosed by r1.  encloses |
|  [extend(o1, o2, keys)](./util.extend) | Equivalent of Object.assign, which IE11 does not support. |

|  [filterList(list, value, missingIsFalse)](./util.filterlist) | Internal method used to filter lists, supporting wildcards. |
|  [filterNull(obj)](./util.filternull) | Returns a copy of the given object that has no null values. Note this only operates one level deep. |
|  [findAllWithFunction(a, predicate)](./util.findallwithfunction) | Find all entries in the given array like object for which the given predicate returns true. |
|  [findWithFunction(a, f)](./util.findwithfunction) | Search each entry in the given array for an entry for which the function <code>f</code> returns true.

|  [functionChain(successValue, failValue, fns)](./util.functionchain) | Chain a list of functions, supplied by \[ object, method name, args \], and return on the first one that returns the failValue. If none return the failValue, return the successValue. This is an internal method. |

|  [getWithFunction(a, f)](./util.getwithfunction) | Find the entry in the given array for which the function <code>f</code> returns true. This is a stand-in replacement for the <code>find</code> method which is available on <code>Array</code> in modern browsers, but not IE11. |

|  [isAssignableFrom(object, cls)](./util.isassignablefrom) | Returns true if the given <code>object</code> can be considered to be an instance of the class <code>cls</code>. This is done by testing the proto chain of the object and checking at each level to see if the proto is an instance of the given class. |

|  [isDate(o)](./util.isdate) | Returns whether or not the given value is of type <code>Date</code> |

|  [lineLength(p1, p2)](./util.linelength) | Calculates the length of a line between the two points.  lineLength  |
|  [lineRectangleIntersection(line, r)](./util.linerectangleintersection) | Finds all points where the given line intersects the given rectangle.  lineRectangleIntersection  |
|  [log(args)](./util.log) | Logs a console message. |
|  [map(obj, fn)](./util.map) | Maps some ArrayLike object. This is of course a copy of a method that typescript offers. It will likely fall out of use in the jsPlumb codebase. |
|  [merge(a, b, collations, overwrites)](./util.merge) | Merge the values from <code>b</code> into the values from <code>a</code>, resulting in <code>c</code>. <code>b</code> and <code>a</code> are unchanged by this method. Not every datatype can be merged - arrays can, and objects can, but primitives (strings/booleans/numbers/functions) cannot, and are overwritten in <code>c</code> by the value from <code>b</code>, if present. |

|  [rotatePoint(point, center, rotation)](./util.rotatepoint) | Rotate the given point around the given center, by the given rotation (in degrees) |
|  [setToArray(s)](./util.settoarray) | Convert a set into an array. This is not needed for modern browsers but for IE11 compatibility we use this in jsplumb. |
|  [snapToGrid(pos, grid, thresholdX, thresholdY)](./util.snaptogrid) | Snap the given x,y to a point on the grid defined by gridX and gridY, using the given thresholds to calculate proximity to the grid.  snapToGrid |
|  [sortHelper(\_array, \_fn)](./util.sorthelper) | Sorts an array. Seems quite unnecessary. Only used in one place in the codebase. Marking deprecated. |
