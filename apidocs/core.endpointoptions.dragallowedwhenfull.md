## EndpointOptions.dragAllowedWhenFull property

Whether or not connections can be dragged from the endpoint when it is full. Since no new connection could be dragged from an endpoint that is full, in a practical sense this means whether or not existing connections can be dragged off an endpoint that is full. Defaults to true.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dragAllowedWhenFull?: boolean;
```
